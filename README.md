# Positive - Online Watch Store

• Implemented HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap) for an overall responsive UI layout 

• Utilized Vanilla JS to create a shopping cart to store the selected items

In this fancy watch store, you can select the extravagant watches that you like and add them to cart to view their total prices (tax-included). You can purchase these chosen items, and then they will be removed from the cart. All this without having to worry about the hefty price tag, and money transactions.
